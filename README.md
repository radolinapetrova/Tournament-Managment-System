The project is a tournament management system that allows users to create and manage tournaments using three different tournament systems: 
round robin, double round robin, and single elimination. 
The system also handles ties by allowing admins to input results and automatically calculates the winner.

The system is built using the ASP.NET framework and incorporates its security features to ensure secure access and data protection. 
This includes user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control.

For the round robin and double round robin tournament systems, the system automatically generates a schedule based on the number of teams and the number of rounds. 

For the single elimination tournament system, the system generates an automatic schedule for the matches, including a final match to determine the winner. 
Admins can input the results of each match, and the system automatically updates the bracket and advances the winning team to the next round until the final winner is determined.

Overall, this tournament management system provides an easy and secure way for users to create and manage tournaments with different tournament systems and handle ties,
while also providing automatic scheduling and result calculations.
